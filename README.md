# nyghtly-app
Website for a (fake) sleep/relaxation app. ðŸ˜´ðŸ§˜ðŸŒº<br>
Made this to practice Bootstrap v5.<br><br>

Includes a navbar, main card with picture and download links, features, pricing plan and footer.<br>
Fully responsive! (not with media queries, honestly I think it does need some to look better in smaller screen sizes).<br><br>
